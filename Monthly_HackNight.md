Monthly Hack Nights
==

Hack nights are a great way for our members to get together and try out the stuff we're learning. 

Our hack nights are consistently rated higher than our regular (presentation-style) meetings. Why? It could be that our members enjoy getting deeply involved in projects and code.

When our customers like what we do we should do more of the same!
