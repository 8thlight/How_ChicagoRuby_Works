Video

Someone once asked the question: "If we make our meetings and conferences available on video, why would anyone attend?"

Why indeed. One could ask the same question about professional sports teams. Pro games are broadcast all the time, and yet the stadiums remain full. Why? Probably because people know that the live, on-site experience is the real experience.

And videos are great for:

* People who want to recall something from a meeting they attended.
* Those who are checking us out... considering whether they want to get involved with ChicagoRuby.

Our [video procedure](http://github.com/chicagoruby/video_procedure) is outlined right here in GitHub.
