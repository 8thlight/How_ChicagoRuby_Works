Monthly Suburban Meetings
==

ChicagoRuby started as "The Chicago Area Ruby on Rails Meetup Group" in Franklin Park, IL. We moved to Elmhurst when one of our members, Lee DeForest, offered his office building as a place for us to meet. Thank you [DeForest Group](http://deforestgroup.com)!

And yes, we shortened the name to ChicagoRuby to make it easier to remember and for SEO purposes.
