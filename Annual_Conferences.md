Annual Conferences
==

As of this writing, our annual conferences are:

* [WindyCityRails](http://windycityrails.org)
* [WindyCityDB](http://windycitydb.org)

We launched our first conference, WindyCityRails, for two reasons:

* To fill a vacuum in the Midwest conference space. Before WindyCityRails, there were no midwest-based Ruby or Rails conferences.
* To cover the monthly expenses of ChicagoRuby, including [Meetup.com](http://meetup.com/chicagoruby), video taping, and any other expenses that the group may incur.

Getting Sponsors
==
Companies choose to sponsor our conferences for these reasons:
* They believe in open source.
* They want to recruit our attendees.
* They have products and/or services to market to our attendees.

Sponsors continue to support our conferences because we offer a crisp & professional product that produces results. As long as we continue to perform well, sponsors will continue to work with us.

Getting Attendees

With the right speakers and sponsors in place, the attendees will come.
