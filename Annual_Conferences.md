Annual Conferences
==

As of this writing, our annual conferences are:

* [WindyCityRails](http://windycityrails.org)
* [WindyCityDB](http://windycitydb.org)

We launched our first conference, WindyCityRails, for these reasons:

* To fill a vacuum in the Midwest conference space. Before WindyCityRails, there were no midwest-based Ruby or Rails conferences.
* To cover the monthly expenses of ChicagoRuby, including [Meetup.com](http://meetup.com/chicagoruby), video taping, and any other expenses that the group may incur.
* To give back to the community. After we cover our expenses, we give profits to the [Greater Chicago Food Depository](http://chicagosfoodbank.org).


Getting Speakers
==
The best speakers want to speak at well-run conferences. Speakers can evaluate our work through attendee feedback and videos.

Our conferences work well when we have the best speakers. We evaluate our speakers through our experience at monthly ChicagoRuby meetings, [SpeakerRate](http://speakerrate.com/), their videos, and reputation.

When the best speakers present at the best conferences, everybody wins.

Getting Sponsors
==
Companies choose to sponsor our conferences for these reasons:

* They believe in open source.
* They want to recruit our attendees.
* They have products and/or services to market to our attendees.

Sponsors continue to support our conferences because we offer a crisp & professional product that produces results. As long as we continue to perform well, sponsors will continue to work with us.

Getting Attendees
==
With the right speakers, sponsors, venue, and professionalism, the attendees will come.
