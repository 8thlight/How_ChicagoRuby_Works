Purpose of This Document
==

The purpose of this document is to increase ChicagoRuby's truck number. An organization's truck number is the number of people in the organization who can be hit by a truck without disrupting the operations of the organization.

Or, expressed more optimistically: If every member of the [ChicagoRuby](http://chicagoruby.org) Organizer Team suddenly decides to leave Chicago for various private islands in the tropics, this document will enable a new team of organizers to pick up where we left off.

Good luck, organizers!


Organization
