Monthly Downtown Meetings
==

Our first downtown meeting was held on June 23, 2009 at the [Illinois Technology Association](http://chicagotechnexus.org). After the merge with [Chirb](http://chirb.org) it made sense to leverage Chirb's relationship with [ThoughtWorks](http://thoughtworks.com), so we moved the downtown meetings there.

Any time a company hosts a ChicagoRuby meeting, it is important to make sure they get value out of the arrangement. Otherwise, the arrangement will evaporate! In the case of ThoughtWorks, they provide ChicagoRuby with meeting space, WiFi, and pizza. ChicagoRuby provides access to our membership. Everybody wins.
