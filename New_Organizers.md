Ideas for New Organizers: What Works
==
If you are a new user group organizer, here are a few things that have worked well for ChicagoRuby since 2007.

Be Very Visible in Google
==

Make sure your group is highly visible in Google. We renamed our group (it used to be called "the Chicago Area Ruby on Rails Meetup Group") and grabbed a domain name that matched the group name. We also made sure that several of our other sites linked to http://ChicagoRuby.org.

Within months after those changes, we became the #1 item on page one for [Chicago Ruby on Rails](http://www.google.com/#hl=en&source=hp&q=chicago+ruby+on+rails&aq=f&aqi=g1&aql=&oq=&gs_rfai=CJy43yI87TMjiMY-GNKHCgNoMAAAAqgQFT9AqJSU&fp=36ec6be010d257f) and other related searches. When we merged with [Chirb](http://chirb.org), we kept the ChicagoRuby name because it ranks higher in the search results.

Focus on the Team
==

Build a team. ChicagoRuby is successful because we have several members (currently seven) on the organizer team pulling together. We don't always agree on tactics, but we certainly agree on the goal, which is to build a great user community.


Have a Consistent Meeting Schedule
==

ChicagoRuby hosts multiple events that always meet on the same day of the month. While we might switch the location, we never switch a date. Here's why: When people are planning their schedules, it's easier if they know that every first Tuesday they have a ChicagoRuby meeting. We can roll with the punches if the topic and/or venue changes. But date changes can be frustrating, and when members get frustrated they stop coming.


Get Great Topics & Presenters
==

Organizers might present sometimes, but members really want to hear from folks that they don't see all the time. We've been blessed w/r/t presenters & topics. Lately, good presenters have been coming to us (we have a team and we're consistent). Also, it helps to have a set of [presenter guidelines](http://chicagoruby.org/about-us/special-notes-for-presenters/) so that the group doesn't get stuck hearing sales pitches.
